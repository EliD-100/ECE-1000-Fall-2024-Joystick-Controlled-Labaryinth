# Joystick-Controlled Labyrinth Game
This GitHub contains all relevant files used during development of our Joystick-Controlled Labyrinth Game project for ECE 1000.
## Project Summary
The game Labyrinth, released over 70 years ago, with a joystick and motors to control the rotation of the plate instead of the player needing to use the 2 provided knobs. The design is intended to be minimalistic, yet effective, just like the origional game. Aside from a Raspberry Pi Pico, the only components used are two servo motors and one dual-axis analog joystick. This allows the player to rotate the board in a desired direction using only the singular joystick, and no outside knowledge is required to play.
## Project Capabilities
This version of the project is very limited, as it is only able to rotate one way for both motors. It's current functionality allows for the motors to rotate in tandem, making the game incredibly difficult, if not impossible to play. The joystick is also far too sensetive, which ups the difficulty further. However, I plan to potentally work on this on my own.
## Who Are We? My ECE 1000 Final project Group
* Jude Lee - Electrical Engineering Major, no concentration - Contributed tools and majorly assisted with the device's construction, as well as contributions to the technical side
* Eli DeSha - Computer Engineering Major, no concentration - Assisted with the construction of the device, but mostly worked on the technical side, with some assistance from Jude
